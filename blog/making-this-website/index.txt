9:T612,## Introduction.

I've been wanting to build a personal website and blog for a while. Thus, I've decided to make it a reality. I want this to be a place where I can share my journey as a machine learning researcher, as a student, and as a person. 

I am a big fan of the good old blog format. I believe is the perfect balance between the formality of traditional academic papers, and the informal style of social media platforms like Twitter. There is nothing in the internet that brings me more joy than stumbling upon a good quality blog post. Though, due to the internet's pollution, such experience has become very rare.

This website is my tiny contribution to the internet I envision. I seek to use it as place where I can share experiments, regardless of their success. I want it to be a place where I can test my ideas, make mistakes, and share my thoughts about the world.

## Inspiration

I wanted to inaugurate my blog by listing the websites and ideas that have inspired the vision and design of what you see while reading me. It is not an overstatement to say that these websites, posts, an authors have shaped my taste for what I consider to be good presentation. The goal is to be as good as them, one day.
